# 👔 Role: Outlet Manager

## 👤 User Persona

**Who are they?**
The person responsible for a _specific_ physical or cloud kitchen location. They bridge the gap between the chaotic kitchen/service operations and the high-level business goals. They are practical, busy, and need tools that save time.

## 🔐 Access Level

- **Routes**: `/manager/*`, `/kitchen/*` (read-only usually), `/pos/*` (to assist).
- **Capabilities**: Manage their specific outlet's staff, local menu pricing/availability, inventory, and shift scheduling.
- **Restrictions**: Cannot see data from _other_ outlets. Cannot delete the Master Menu items (only hide them).

## 🔄 Daily Workflow

1.  **Start of Day**: Unlock the POS system. Check staff attendance.
2.  **Inventory Check**: quickly mark "Fresh Lobster" as _Out of Stock_ because the delivery didn't arrive.
3.  **Operations**: Monitor the live dashboard for high wait times in the kitchen; reassign a prep cook to the main line.
4.  **Issue Resolution**: A customer complains about a wrong order; the Manager approves a discount in the system.
5.  **End of Day**: Generate the "Z-Report" (daily closing), verify cash drawer, and lock any sensitive inventory.
